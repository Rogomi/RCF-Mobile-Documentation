## Right Choice Finance
### Technical Documentation


#### GETTING STARTED

Right Choice Finance iOS requires Xcode 11.0 and above for development. This project uses Swift 5 as the Programming Language, Storyboard for the Interface and CocoaPods for Third Party Libraries. The current Xcode version used for development is 11.5. The minimum iOS Version required is iOS 12.0


#### INSTALLATION AND DEVELOPMENT

In order to start with the development, first, you will need an Apple account for development. It must be under the team **Rogomi, Inc.**. Then, open the **RightChoiceFinance-iOS.xcworkspace** under the repository root directory. If possible, do a **pods repo update** in order to avoid missing library errors.
